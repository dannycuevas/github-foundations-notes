# GIT

### What is GIT?
-Git is a Version Control System, Free and Open Source

-What is a Version Control System?
It is a Software that helps track and manage changes to a set of files over time

-Version Control Systems offer:
Allow users to revisit earlier versions of files
Comparing changes made between different versions of the files
Undoing changes to the files
Sharing changes with other people
Or combine the changes
Git does this and more

# GIT PHASES

-Ignored Files
Files ignored by .gitignore file

-Working Area:
    -untracked
    -modified

-Staging Area:
    -files ready to be committed with "commit -m" command


# GIT CHEAT SHEET

-Check if GIT is already installed
git --version

> git config --global user.name "Daniel Cuevas"
> git config --global user.email "xxx@xxx.com"

-Check "if" the Git username has been configured
git config user.name
git config user.email

-Editing and configuring the user and user email in a simple way
git config --global --edit

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁 : This is the very first command you'll need to use when starting a new project. It initializes a new Git repository in your current working directory. Or it can reinitialize an existing repo.

-GIT is going to monitor everything that happens in the main working directory including anything nested further down, like "child" or "grandchild" directories and so on.
-Before running GIT INIT, use GIT STATUS toverify that you are not already currently inside of a repo, because it might cause issues at some point. You can possibly fix these issues with deleting extra ".git" folders, just fyi.

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗲 <𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗼> : To work on an existing project, you'll want to clone (copy) it to your local machine. This command does that.


## MAKE CHANGES

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 : Before making or after making changes, it's good practice to check the status of your files. This command will show you any changes that are currently unstaged, along with the status of your git repo and its contents.

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗱𝗱 <𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲> : After you've made some changes to your files, you'll want to stage them for a commit. This command adds a specific file to the stage.

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗱𝗱 . 𝗼𝗿 𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗱𝗱 -𝗔 : Instead of adding files one by one, you can add all your changed files to the stage with one command.

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add

-NOTE:
-When ADDING, we can add changes to a group of files 1st and then commit those specific changes, and then make changes to a 2nd batch of different files and then commit the 2nd batch of files, these can help us "separate" changes made to different groups of files with different "commits".

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗶𝘁 -𝗺 "𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲" : Now that your changes are staged, you can commit them with a descriptive message.

-Display what was changed in the very last commit
git show


## UNDO CHANGES
-LINKS:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset

-When you have made changes to files in your repo, and you decide not to ADD or commit these changes, and you actually want to "restore" the file to its original state in the LAST commit, and you restore manually file by file

git restore FILE-NAME
git restore variables.tf

-If you have accidentally ADDED a file to your "Staging Area" with git add, and you actually do not wish to include that file in the next commit, you can remove that file from staging
-Removing a file from the Staging Area (committed file), moves back the file in the previous state as a "modified file" only

git restore --staged FILE-NAME
git restore --staged story1.txt

-Reset command allows you to move "Staged" changes to "Unstaged" status
this is useful when you decided not to commit all the staged changes

git add .
git reset

-To undo your commits, you can use git reset to reset the repo back to a specific commit, also the commits will be gone as well

git reset COMMIT-HASH
git reset --hard COMMIT-HASH


## BRANCHING
-LINKS:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵 : This command will list all the current local branches in your current repository.

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵 <𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲> : This command creates a new branch. Should not include spaces.

-This will create the new branch "based off of the HEAD" where we currently were, so it "points" to that same exact spot.
-Example last most recent commit
"commit 87efbe07466c60192d855e4a3151e9528f29253c (HEAD -> master, superheroes, SongsList)"

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗼𝘂𝘁 <𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲> : If you want to switch to a different branch, old version for some contexts.
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout

-Always commit your changes before switching branches, or you will run into some conflicts.

git switch branch-name : Current and New command to switch to a different branch.
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch

git switch - : Return to the last branch

git switch -c branch-name : Create and switch to the newly created branch in a single command.

-Deletes a branch by their name:
git branch -d branch-name
git branch --delete branch-name

git branch -D : Shortcut for --delete --force, in other words, deleting a branch no matter its status.

git branch -v : Display all your branches with their Last commit only, in the form of a list, along with their commit message

### Branch Rename
-First change/switch to the branch that we want to rename

git branch -m new-name
git branch --move new-name

git branch -M new-name : shortcut for --move --force

### Merging Branches
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge
-We "merge" the "branches", we do not merge specific "commits"
-We always merge the current HEAD branch

-First switch into the branch you want to merge branches into (the receiveing branch)
-Use "git merge" to merge the mentioned "target branch name" into the current branch we are sitting in

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 <𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲> : Once you've finished making changes in your current branch, run this command followed by the "target branch" to merge both branches


# REMOTE REPOSITORIES

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗽𝘂𝘀𝗵 𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗶𝗻 <𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲> : This command sends your commits to the remote repository.

-Use Rebase to Pull from a newly connected remote repo into the local repo
git pull --rebase
git pull

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗲 -𝘃 : To check which remote servers are connected with your local repository.

## Remote Repo Status
-If you want to check if the remote repository is ahead of your local repository, you can use the following Git command:

git fetch
git status -uno

-The git fetch command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your working branch.
-The -uno option with git status displays the status without showing changes that are not staged.
-After running these commands, you'll be able to see if the remote repository is ahead of your local repository and if there are changes you need to pull.

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗹 : If other people are also working on your project, you'll want to keep your local repo up-to-date with their changes. This command fetches and merges any changes from the remote repository.

# 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀
-Study well these commands, they may come in handy

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝘃𝘀 𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗹: Both download data from a remote repository. However, git fetch just downloads it without integrating it, while git pull also merges it into your local files.

-So "git pull" is actually 2 commands in one, it is the combination of "git fetch" and "git merge".

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝘃𝘀 𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲: Both incorporate changes from one branch to another. git merge combines the source and target branches via a new commit, whereas git rebase moves or combines commits to a new base, making a cleaner history.

𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝘃𝘀 𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁: Both are used to undo changes. git reset discards local changes completely, while git revert undoes public changes by creating a new reversing commit, thereby preserving history.


# GIT IGNORE

-Sometimes we want to "ignore" files in our current working directory, to prevent these files to be ever added to a "track" status, or "modified" or "committed" status, that way we can continously modify those files and never having to fear committing them and pushing them by mistake, to do this, we tell GIT to "ignore" these files

-To ignore files, we sent them to our local ".gitignore" file

echo "FILE.NAME" >> .gitignore
echo "storyfinal.txt" >> .gitignore

-NOTE: As you might have noticed the .gitignore file itself may be listed as untracked. It is a good practice to track the .gitignore file with git

-To ignore directories use "/" at the end of their name

.DS_Store = will ignore files named .DS_Store
folderName/ = will ignore an entire directory
'*.log' = will ignore any files with the .log extension


# GIT DIFF

-The "git diff" command is all about showing changes in git
-It is purely an informative command, it does not apply any sort of changes at all
-Example, in any given repo, there are many situations where we might wanna know WHAT changed between the LAST commits and our working repo

-Or what has changed between the staging area AND the working directory
-Or what has changed between 2 branches, or 2 different files over a certain number of commits

## git diff command
-Lists all the changes in our working directory that are not staged for the next commit
-So it compares the staging area and our working directory

### Example code
-The plus sign + with the green text represent the newly added text
-The lines with - and red text mean the old text that is now gone
-The symbols --- represent the old version of the file
-While the +++ represent the new version of the file
-And for the new text that was added/change, it will show some context "text" that resides before and after the newly added text (if there is any)
-The text @@ -7,3 +7,4 @@ tells us it is the beginning of a chunk of text where there were changes to be visualized

### git diff HEAD
-This one will list all the changes in the working directory since the LAST commit
-It is pointing to the last commit of HEAD, meaning whatever HEAD is at that specific moment, which could be any given branch
-This is use to see the last changes to any SPECIFIC branch

### git diff --staged
git diff --cached
-Both of them will show us the staged changes, ONLY the changes that are staged (the files that have been "git add"ed )
-Meaning "Only show me the staged changes, so show me what will be included in my Commit if I run git commit right now"

### git diff HEAD file-name
git diff HEAD file-name1 file-name2
-We can view the changes within a specific FILE by providing a file-name
-Example
git diff HEAD characters.txt

### git diff branch1..branch2
-This will list the changes between the tips of branch1 and branch2
-It will include ALL the files in the branches, but you can narrow it down manually if needed

###git diff commit1..commit2
-To compare 2 different commits, not necessarily HEAD so it can be any pair of commits even from the past
-Example
git log --oneline
git diff 42171df..cf877be



# GIT LOG
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log

-It has many capabilities, like you can filter things out based on
Who wrote the commits
When they were committed (dates of the commits)
Etc

-List all the "changed files" that were in the most recent commit, along with their authors and dates
git log --name-only

### Commit Formatting "--pretty" option

"--pretty"
-It allows to pretty print or change the format of the logs (how they are printed out)

### log --online command

"--oneline"
-Shorthand for "--pretty" and "--abbrev-commit" used together
-This is massive to help you READ ALL of the commits in the current repo
-Will also show each commits HASH

-Look at the history of commits in the current branch, to see from "what" branch it came from and when
git log --graph --decorate
