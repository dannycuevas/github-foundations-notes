-This is not to be confused with distributed version control system (DVCS), because these are 2 separate things

-This is about "Version Control Services" (VCS)


# VCS

-Version Control Services are fully managed cloud services that hosts your Version Controlled Repositories
-These services often have additional functionality going beyond just being a remote host for your repos
-We often calle these VCS as "git providers"


# VCS Examples

### GitHub
-Owned by Microsoft, most popular VCS offering due to ease of use and being around the longest
-GitHub is primarily where open-source projects are hosted and offer rich functionality such as "issue tracking", "automation pipelines", and other features

### GitLab
-Competitor to github and at the time had "unique features" like pipelines and improved security measures, no longer the case as github now has all these features

### Bitbucket
-Onwned by Atlassian (the same company that makes Jira)
-Originally hosted "mercurial", and then later adding GIT
-Tight integration witn Atlassian's industry standard Agile Project Management software JIRA
-Larger organizations commonly use Bitbucket because of JIRA adoption

### SourceForge
-One of the oldest places to host your source code
